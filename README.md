# Hello, I'm Valentin

I am 17 years old. I'm currently in my second year of a Level 3 Diploma in Policing, which has equipped me with a strong foundation in investigative techniques, problem-solving, and understanding security protocols.
These skills are directly applicable to cybersecurity, and I plan to pursue a career in the field after finishing my course. 
Throughout the course, I've gained knowledge in areas like risk assessment, ethical hacking, network security, and handling sensitive data—skills that I am eager to apply in a professional cybersecurity environment.
I'm passionate about ethical hacking, and my goal is to use my knowledge to help organizations secure their systems and data. 
I have always been fascinated by technology and how it affects our daily lives, and my journey into cybersecurity started as I realized the growing importance of securing digital systems.
My policing background provides me with a unique perspective on security, and I’m determined to build a career where I can combine both areas. 
I'm particularly interested in ethical hacking and penetration testing, and I look forward to contributing to the cybersecurity community by helping organizations strengthen their defenses against cyber threats. 
I’m eager to continue learning and developing my skills, and I'm excited about the endless opportunities the field of cybersecurity offers.

## Objective

I am a dedicated and driven individual with a strong foundation in investigative techniques, problem-solving, and security protocols, developed through my studies in Policing. My passion for technology and cybersecurity, particularly in ethical hacking and penetration testing, motivates me to pursue a career in the field. I aim to apply my knowledge of risk assessment, network security, and handling sensitive data to help organizations safeguard their systems against cyber threats. With a unique perspective gained from my policing background, I am eager to contribute to the cybersecurity community and continue expanding my skills in this dynamic and essential field.

## Skills
**Basic Networking:** I understand how computers connect and communicate over networks. This helps me identify and fix network-related security issues, which is crucial for keeping systems secure.

**Password Security:** I know how to create strong passwords and use multi-factor authentication to keep accounts safe from hackers.

**Threat Identification:** I can spot common cyber threats like malware or phishing attacks, which helps me stay ahead of potential security risks and protect systems from harm.

**Risk Assessment** I assess the risks associated with different security threats, so I can prioritize and protect the most important data and systems first.

**Ethical Hacking (Basics):** I’ve learned how to test systems for weaknesses in a legal and ethical way, helping organizations find and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

**Cybersecurity Awareness:** I stay up-to-date on the latest security threats and understand how to protect myself and others from cyber risks.

**Investigative Skills:** I use my investigative skills to analyze security incidents, such as figuring out how a cyberattack happened and what can be done to prevent it in the future.

**Problem Solving:** I enjoy using my critical thinking to solve complex security challenges, like addressing vulnerabilities or handling security breaches.

**Security Protocols:** I understand the rules and procedures that keep data and systems safe. This helps me ensure that security measures are followed properly.

**Data Handling:** I know how to manage sensitive data carefully, making sure it’s protected from unauthorized access or leaks—something I take very seriously in cybersecurity.

**Critical Thinking:** I use critical thinking to analyze situations and make smart, informed decisions about security risks, ensuring I find the best ways to prevent attacks or fix issues.

**Communication Skills:** I can clearly explain security issues to both technical and non-technical people, which is important when reporting incidents or helping others understand how to stay safe online.

## Projects

- **Network Security Lab** - I set up a home lab using virtual machines to simulate a secure network environment. Configured firewalls, segmented networks, and tested security policies using Nmap to identify vulnerabilities.
  
- **Vulnerability Scanning** - Used **Nessus Essentials** to scan a local network for vulnerabilities, analyzed the results, and applied fixes such as patching software and securing configurations to enhance security
