# Hello, I'm Valentin

I am 17 years old. I'm currently in my second year of a Level 3 Diploma in Policing, which has equipped me with a strong foundation in investigative techniques, problem-solving, and understanding security protocols.
These skills are directly applicable to cybersecurity, and I plan to pursue a career in the field after finishing my course. 
Throughout the course, I've gained knowledge in areas like risk assessment, ethical hacking, network security, and handling sensitive data—skills that I am eager to apply in a professional cybersecurity environment.
I'm passionate about ethical hacking, and my goal is to use my knowledge to help organizations secure their systems and data. 
I have always been fascinated by technology and how it affects our daily lives, and my journey into cybersecurity started as I realized the growing importance of securing digital systems.
My policing background provides me with a unique perspective on security, and I’m determined to build a career where I can combine both areas. 
I'm particularly interested in ethical hacking and penetration testing, and I look forward to contributing to the cybersecurity community by helping organizations strengthen their defenses against cyber threats. 
I’m eager to continue learning and developing my skills, and I'm excited about the endless opportunities the field of cybersecurity offers.
